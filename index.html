    <br>This dog is over it
    
    <p>
    Honestly if I really think about it, I don't even know when I'll realize that I've made this. Maybe I'll return to this webpage with a silly laugh, wondering what I was doing during this time in my life. Another instance, maybe I might find myself wondering how life was good before I got to where I am in the future.

    Will I ever be this happy? I'm not too sure, but all I know is that there will always be days where I relate to this dog.
